# ðŸŽ¥ WebScraping Metacritic Movies

Welcome to my **WebScraping Metacritic Movies** project! This project extracts movie data from Metacritic for the year **2020**. I gathered essential information like **titles, release dates, and summaries**, and went a step further by also retrieving **ratings and Metascores**. This was my first experience with web scraping, and I used **Python, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas** to accomplish it.
